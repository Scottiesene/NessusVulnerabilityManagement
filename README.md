# Nessus Vulnerability Management Walkthrough


## Introduction

We will effectively learn how to use Nessus to run a vulnerability scan on a virtual machine that we will analyze on our host machine. We will use VMware and Nessus, as well as very basic commands in the command line of a windows system. This process will be as step-by-step as possible to allow for a seamless process. Screenshots will also be provided. (some versions have been updated, and menu options for web applications may vary) Lets Begin!

## Downloading VMware / Windows ISO file / Nessus Essentials
First, we will need to download VMWare and install this on our system.
You can access the download page [Here](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player/workstation-player-evaluation.html).

You should end up here where you will click download for windows and begin the download process.

While this is downloading you can begin downloading the Windows 10 ISO, which will allow us to install Windows 10 on our virtual machine.[Link](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10) provided.

Navigate over to the "Download tool now" button and click. After accepting the licensing agreement you will be brought here.

Once done, you will be prompted to choose between upgrading or choosing to create installation media. BE SURE to create installation media as depicted above. Select next on the language, architecture, and edition prompt, and observe the next prompt that you will see depicted below.

Select ISO file, and choose a location on your system where you would like to store the file. Just remember where you chose to save it.

This will show the progress of your download, and while this is downloading, we can begin our next step. The next step will be to download [Nessus Essentials](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus/nessus-essentials), which is the vulnerability scanner we will be using to conduct our scans. You will be brought to a page that looks like this:

You will fillout this registration form in order to recieve an activation code at the email you provide.

After completion you will get a “Thank You” message along with an email to the email you provided. The email should provide the activation code and should look something like this:

![image](https://github.com/Scottiesene/NessusVulnerabilityManagement/assets/151565915/a2f879c6-e208-45ec-b071-0ff181425cd6)

You will get a personalized code and you will see there is also a download button. Copy the activation code, and press the “Download Nessus” button to continue

Click the first option that says, “Tenable Nessus.”

![image](https://github.com/Scottiesene/NessusVulnerabilityManagement/assets/151565915/74e1ba51-e97d-4c2b-840a-8f07bdb76097)

The version I downloaded was sure to include windows 10. The options tend to change from time to time on Tenable, so just be sure your version includes Windows 10, so we can make sure it will be compatible with our ISO version. You’re going to want to “next” your way through the following prompts and accept the user agreement, in order to install and finish the download process.

After completing these steps, you will see something similar to this:

![image](https://github.com/Scottiesene/NessusVulnerabilityManagement/assets/151565915/2576e591-cb69-45ac-a6e2-9635ed6afb62)

On your machine you will see the host in the URL bar. Good practice would be to save this somewhere safe, because it can be a pain to recover if lost. You will also be given the option to “Connect via SSL”. Select this option. After, you will be brought to a screen that may look scary, but do not worry. The visual may vary, but just be sure to click the “Advanced” option, followed by the “Proceed to local host” option.

Nessus will begin installing. NOTE: This can take some time. Once this is done, download the free version of Nessus which is going to be the “Nessus Essentials” option. Afterwards enter your Activation code in the provided box as depicted below.

![image](https://github.com/Scottiesene/NessusVulnerabilityManagement/assets/151565915/92df43cd-dd50-4fa1-a8ce-680c24cc1a60)

Once this is done the program will begin initialization.

We can now check the VM installation

## Virtual Machine Installation / Configuration

Click the “Finish” Option and open the VM workstation. Then open file dropdown, and select “New Virtual Machine”

![image](https://github.com/Scottiesene/NessusVulnerabilityManagement/assets/151565915/bd39a058-c21b-4ce5-a4fd-205ff6d1bd66)

Make sure the ISO file you created is selected and press select next.

Enter the "Customize Hardware" section. You will see multiple options.

![image](https://github.com/Scottiesene/NessusVulnerabilityManagement/assets/151565915/f8c87ffc-6522-448f-9f1e-260141415825)

You shouldn’t need to tinker with any settings other than the Network adapter option which you will change to “bridged” as shown below. Close and then Finish and allow the VM to power on. 

![image](https://github.com/Scottiesene/NessusVulnerabilityManagement/assets/151565915/b0b77a50-83d4-4d2d-b327-7b5cead0a0f4)

Once this happens be sure to press a key when prompted

![image](https://github.com/Scottiesene/NessusVulnerabilityManagement/assets/151565915/1c1826e3-904a-4be1-b1c4-49d21782be4b)

When it begins to load the next process just click “Install Now”, select “I don’t have a product key”. In the dropdown after, select “Windows 10 Pro” Each step is shown respectively below.

There will be another "next" button to press as well as a “Custom Setup” option that will need to be selected afterwards. At this point the drive that was just created needs to be selected so we can install Windows 10 Pro on our VM.

![image](https://github.com/Scottiesene/NessusVulnerabilityManagement/assets/151565915/ab9488fa-ff7c-4bc7-b6e9-58719e159184)

Once you select the region and conduct some initial setup options, the program will start another loading process. BE SURE to select the “Personal Use” option, and the “Offline Account” option. (These may vary due to system and version of the software at the time). 
Here comes another important part of the process. Create the username and the password. Make sure the password is something simple enough for you to recall, because this will be used to run a credentialed scan later in the process. It is also time to pull up the Nessus program and sign into it, so we can get ready for the scanning process

Once the VM is loaded, we will conduct a simple command in the Windows Control Panel of the VM. This is done to get the IPv4 address

![image](https://github.com/Scottiesene/NessusVulnerabilityManagement/assets/151565915/df010896-48a9-43f8-9790-35f0c3e60e30)

With this information we can now run a command on our own machine's command line. So, at this point we will go ahead and open our command line and input this command: ping 10.0.0.189 -t. In short, this will continue to use the ping command and search for the IP address that is input. This is the reply we should receive:

In this project, I build a honeypot in Azure, ingest log sources and integrate them into a Log Analytics workspace, which is then used by Microsoft Sentinel to build attack maps, trigger alerts, and create incidents based on the ingested logs. The final product is a map of the attackers attempts to gain entry into the system.


## Creation / Configuring of Virtual Machine and Log Analytics Workspace

Here we are Microsoft Azure creating our Virtual Machine, making sure to allow traffic for all ports. This is done in order to be as discoverable as possible.
