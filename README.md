# Nessus Vulnerability Management Walkthrough


## Introduction

We will effectively learn how to use Nessus to run a vulnerability scan on a virtual machine that we will analyze on our host machine. We will use VMware and Nessus, as well as very basic commands in the command line of a windows system. This process will be as step-by-step as possible to allow for a seamless process. Screenshots will also be provided. (some versions have been updated, and menu options for web applications may vary) Lets Begin!

## Downloading VMware / Windows ISO file / Nessus Essentials
First, we will need to download VMWare and install this on our system.
You can access the download page [Here](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player/workstation-player-evaluation.html).

You should end up here where you will click download for windows and begin the download process.

While this is downloading you can begin downloading the Windows 10 ISO, which will allow us to install Windows 10 on our virtual machine.[Link](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10) provided.

Select ISO file, and choose a location on your system where you would like to store the file. Just remember where you chose to save it. 

![image](https://github.com/Scottiesene/NessusVulnerabilityManagement/assets/151565915/9d077b0e-6728-405f-8619-e35fe79cf292)

This will show the progress of your download, and while this is downloading, we can begin our next step. The next step will be to download [Nessus Essentials](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus/nessus-essentials), which is the vulnerability scanner we will be using to conduct our scans. You will be brought to a page that looks like this:

![image](https://github.com/Scottiesene/NessusVulnerabilityManagement/assets/151565915/87fe798c-12d4-49a0-ae41-b22bf14d37ca)

You will fillout this registration form in order to recieve an activation code at the email you provide.

![image](https://github.com/Scottiesene/NessusVulnerabilityManagement/assets/151565915/85e4fdc0-9b0b-4d47-9ab9-5d3534d0368c)

After completion you will get a “Thank You” message along with an email to the email you provided. The email should provide the activation code and should look something like this:

![image](https://github.com/Scottiesene/NessusVulnerabilityManagement/assets/151565915/a2f879c6-e208-45ec-b071-0ff181425cd6)

You will get a personalized code and you will see there is also a download button. Copy the activation code, and press the “Download Nessus” button to continue

![image](https://github.com/Scottiesene/NessusVulnerabilityManagement/assets/151565915/9581b825-2eb4-48a9-9dca-2371a9129186)

Click the first option that says, “Tenable Nessus.”

![image](https://github.com/Scottiesene/NessusVulnerabilityManagement/assets/151565915/74e1ba51-e97d-4c2b-840a-8f07bdb76097)

The version I downloaded was sure to include windows 10. The options tend to change from time to time on Tenable, so just be sure your version includes Windows 10, so we can make sure it will be compatible with our ISO version. You’re going to want to “next” your way through the following prompts and accept the user agreement, in order to install and finish the download process.

After completing these steps, you will see something similar to this:

![image](https://github.com/Scottiesene/NessusVulnerabilityManagement/assets/151565915/2576e591-cb69-45ac-a6e2-9635ed6afb62)

On your machine you will see the host in the URL bar. Good practice would be to save this somewhere safe, because it can be a pain to recover if lost. You will also be given the option to “Connect via SSL”. Select this option. After, you will be brought to a screen that may look scary, but do not worry. The visual may vary, but just be sure to click the “Advanced” option, followed by the “Proceed to local host” option.

![image](https://github.com/Scottiesene/NessusVulnerabilityManagement/assets/151565915/a74d6bd7-cbdb-4f73-a984-5e81bd21e108)

Nessus will begin installing. NOTE: This can take some time. Once this is done, download the free version of Nessus which is going to be the “Nessus Essentials” option. Afterwards enter your Activation code in the provided box as depicted below.

![image](https://github.com/Scottiesene/NessusVulnerabilityManagement/assets/151565915/92df43cd-dd50-4fa1-a8ce-680c24cc1a60)

Once this is done the program will begin initialization.

![image](https://github.com/Scottiesene/NessusVulnerabilityManagement/assets/151565915/16a501ba-059f-4245-a742-6409189c75f9)

We can now check the VM installation

## Virtual Machine Installation / Configuration

![image](https://github.com/Scottiesene/NessusVulnerabilityManagement/assets/151565915/0e0c4455-bb98-48be-abca-291be1b105e9)

Click the “Finish” Option and open the VM workstation. Then open file dropdown, and select “New Virtual Machine”

![image](https://github.com/Scottiesene/NessusVulnerabilityManagement/assets/151565915/bd39a058-c21b-4ce5-a4fd-205ff6d1bd66)

Make sure the ISO file you created is selected and press select next.

![image](https://github.com/Scottiesene/NessusVulnerabilityManagement/assets/151565915/0d61c7d0-6726-47be-a3b3-c0e9bcab9335)

Enter the "Customize Hardware" section. You will see multiple options.

![image](https://github.com/Scottiesene/NessusVulnerabilityManagement/assets/151565915/f8c87ffc-6522-448f-9f1e-260141415825)

You shouldn’t need to tinker with any settings other than the Network adapter option which you will change to “bridged” as shown below. Close and then Finish and allow the VM to power on. 

![image](https://github.com/Scottiesene/NessusVulnerabilityManagement/assets/151565915/b0b77a50-83d4-4d2d-b327-7b5cead0a0f4)

Once this happens be sure to press a key when prompted

![image](https://github.com/Scottiesene/NessusVulnerabilityManagement/assets/151565915/1c1826e3-904a-4be1-b1c4-49d21782be4b)

When it begins to load the next process just click “Install Now”, select “I don’t have a product key”. In the dropdown after, select “Windows 10 Pro” Each step is shown respectively below.

![image](https://github.com/Scottiesene/NessusVulnerabilityManagement/assets/151565915/36ae6a20-340b-480d-bc93-50ba0ddb0879)

![image](https://github.com/Scottiesene/NessusVulnerabilityManagement/assets/151565915/6e2175b1-164f-48df-8b20-3fefa210032d)

![image](https://github.com/Scottiesene/NessusVulnerabilityManagement/assets/151565915/d65b8013-3f24-4a53-b3b3-54dfbf45abd1)

There will be another "next" button to press as well as a “Custom Setup” option that will need to be selected afterwards. At this point the drive that was just created needs to be selected so we can install Windows 10 Pro on our VM.

![image](https://github.com/Scottiesene/NessusVulnerabilityManagement/assets/151565915/ab9488fa-ff7c-4bc7-b6e9-58719e159184)

Once you select the region and conduct some initial setup options, the program will start another loading process. BE SURE to select the “Personal Use” option, and the “Offline Account” option. (These may vary due to system and version of the software at the time). 
Here comes another important part of the process. Create the username and the password. Make sure the password is something simple enough for you to recall, because this will be used to run a credentialed scan later in the process. It is also time to pull up the Nessus program and sign into it, so we can get ready for the scanning process

![image](https://github.com/Scottiesene/NessusVulnerabilityManagement/assets/151565915/de11c4be-1b08-4b99-a27e-36c15ffc20af)

Once the VM is loaded, we will conduct a simple command in the Windows Control Panel of the VM. This is done to get the IPv4 address

![image](https://github.com/Scottiesene/NessusVulnerabilityManagement/assets/151565915/df010896-48a9-43f8-9790-35f0c3e60e30)

With this information we can now run a command on our own machine's command line. So, at this point we will go ahead and open our command line and input this command: ping 10.0.0.189 -t. In short, this will continue to use the ping command and search for the IP address that is input. This is the reply we should receive:

![image](https://github.com/Scottiesene/NessusVulnerabilityManagement/assets/151565915/6377765e-71c4-4f96-b0be-0d9c91c520dd)

This is received because we haven’t turned off the firewall on our virtual machine. We will do this now. Go to the VM and search "wf.msc" in the search bar. This will show the current firewall settings and display clearly what needs to be adjusted. This is an essential part of the process because this will allow for our host (actual system, not the VM) to be able to find our VM.

![image](https://github.com/Scottiesene/NessusVulnerabilityManagement/assets/151565915/7c78b277-d12c-43f0-ad3b-7924d6a70d9e)

Open the Windows Firewall Properties

![image](https://github.com/Scottiesene/NessusVulnerabilityManagement/assets/151565915/45006f8b-51c0-43b0-8f07-2d8be4c1021f)

Make sure at this point we go to the Domain, Private, and Public Profiles and turn the firewall state to “off”.

![image](https://github.com/Scottiesene/NessusVulnerabilityManagement/assets/151565915/9f41a316-ce7e-4c41-a4c0-71e38ccb65ba)

![image](https://github.com/Scottiesene/NessusVulnerabilityManagement/assets/151565915/9ce4dfc8-e05f-4785-8427-02e207effb53)

Once this is complete, the ping requests will begin to come through.

![image](https://github.com/Scottiesene/NessusVulnerabilityManagement/assets/151565915/ec0ffaeb-fc96-45c9-ad5f-9360abf61911)

Use the control+c command to stop the ping request. Open Nessus and under “My Scans” go to Basic Network Scan.

![image](https://github.com/Scottiesene/NessusVulnerabilityManagement/assets/151565915/8501be72-6de2-45f3-9f54-46a6cd376bbd)


## Scanning for Vulnerabilities with Nessus

You can name the scan whatever you like, in this example “Windows 10 Single Host” is used. In the “Targets” section, the IPv4 address that we received earlier will be used. In this instance, the IP is 10.0.0.189. (See Below)

![image](https://github.com/Scottiesene/NessusVulnerabilityManagement/assets/151565915/49f4d6c7-d917-4e49-8544-3e0b6a8155bc)

Once we save, we will see our scan displayed in a menu. This scan isn’t currently taking place, but this is our scan that we configured and should now be ready to run.

![image](https://github.com/Scottiesene/NessusVulnerabilityManagement/assets/151565915/a490fd5d-1010-42c9-9ea0-928cc26ab99e)

We can then hover the cursor over what is commonly referred to as a “play” button but in this case, it is a launch button. Click launch and the scan will begin. 

![image](https://github.com/Scottiesene/NessusVulnerabilityManagement/assets/151565915/6878a5d2-78c4-469b-ad97-64bba6cab50d)

Of course, things such as time may vary.

![image](https://github.com/Scottiesene/NessusVulnerabilityManagement/assets/151565915/780c6748-875c-4008-b399-c30a83a59ca9)

This is an example of output you may receive once the scan has been conducted. (Below) We can see the “key”, or color coordination given to different levels of the vulnerabilities on the bottom right. We will now take a look at the vulnerabilities in list form.

![image](https://github.com/Scottiesene/NessusVulnerabilityManagement/assets/151565915/ebc8678e-f88a-485b-96af-d82b508ccc2b)

Taking a look at the first vulnerability here, we get a bit more insight and also recommended potential remediation techniques. Thus, allowing the owner of a system to know what the potential is for harm that could be done to their machine.

## Conclusion

Here we have it! We have used a VM using older software to show the potential vulnerabilities of a system. We have also learned how to use Nessus, a very popular vulnerability scanner in the cybersecurity sector, and how to apply Nessus to a real-world scenario where vulnerabilities are found, and we are given remediation techniques in order to either eradicate or limit or vulnerabilities!

In closing, I would like to thank you for viewing this step-by-step process. After the experience with this type of workload, I may show experiences with my other projects a bit differently due to the amount of time and editing involved in showing everything in a how-to kind of process. It’s possible that voiceovers may be used but I can’t say for sure just yet, as I do still enjoy being able to show each process and it also displays that I’m aware of how different things work. I would also like to let whoever may be reading this know, whether you are already a cybersecurity pro, or you’re working diligently to land your first role, or anywhere above, beyond, or between, that I am genuinely grateful for you to have read this far. As many of us know, that first breakthrough may be tough, but the hard work will always pay off. Stay safe, and CHECK FOR VULNERABILITIES!
