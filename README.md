# Nessus Vulnerability Management Walkthrough


## Introduction

We will effectively learn how to use Nessus to run a vulnerability scan on a virtual machine that we will analyze on our host machine. We will use VMware and Nessus, as well as very basic commands in the command line of a windows system. This process will be as step-by-step as possible to allow for a seamless process. Screenshots will also be provided. (some versions have been updated, and menu options for web applications may vary) Lets Begin!
First, we will need to download VMWare and install this on our system.
You can access the download page [Here](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player/workstation-player-evaluation.html).

In this project, I build a honeypot in Azure, ingest log sources and integrate them into a Log Analytics workspace, which is then used by Microsoft Sentinel to build attack maps, trigger alerts, and create incidents based on the ingested logs. The final product is a map of the attackers attempts to gain entry into the system.



## Creation / Configuring of Virtual Machine and Log Analytics Workspace

Here we are Microsoft Azure creating our Virtual Machine, making sure to allow traffic for all ports. This is done in order to be as discoverable as possible.
